# School Platform

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive platform for Schools and Universities in Morocco. The platform will allow users to filter schools and universities by various important filters such as city, type, formation, private or free, and more. The platform will be similar to [Pappers Immobilier](https://immobilier.pappers.fr/), which provides real estate data in an open data format.

## Vision

We aim to develop a user-friendly platform where users can:
- Filter schools and universities by important criteria.
- View detailed information about each institution.
- Receive recommendations based on their academic background and performance.

## Needs

### Technical Needs
1. **Frontend Development**
   - Framework: React.js (Create React App)
   - Styling: CSS, Sass, or styled-components
   - State Management: Redux or Context API
   - Routing: React Router

2. **Backend Development**
   - Framework: Node.js with Express.js or Django
   - Database: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL
   - Authentication: JWT or OAuth

3. **AI Integration**
   - AI Model: TensorFlow.js or a suitable machine learning library
   - Data Collection: Academic records, school acceptance criteria

4. **DevOps**
   - CI/CD: GitHub Actions or Jenkins
   - Hosting: AWS, Heroku, or Vercel
   - Containerization: Docker

5. **Project Management**
   - Kanban Board: Trello or GitHub Projects
   - Task Management: Assign tasks, set deadlines, track progress

### Resources
1. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for setting up and contributing to the project.
   - Include API documentation if applicable.

2. **Collaboration**
   - Set up a communication channel (Slack, Discord, or Microsoft Teams) for team collaboration.

3. **Design**
   - UI/UX Design: Figma or Adobe XD for designing the user interface and user experience.

### Future Enhancements

- We plan to integrate an AI agent that will help users by analyzing their academic background (e.g., "bac Science math 14/20") and suggesting schools and universities that match their profile.

## Development Workflow

1. Choose the stack of your choice for development.
2. Create a Kanban-style board (e.g., Trello) to manage tasks and updates.
3. Provide regular updates on the progress and any challenges faced.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
